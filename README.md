Licensing Concerns:

Since Plumble was originally based of of @pcgod's non-free code, files not created (or not entirely authored) by myself are being rewritten at the [Jumble repository](https://www.github.com/Morlunk/Jumble) under the Apache License v2. All new feature development will occur there. Thank you for your patience.

If you can get in contact with @pcgod in any way, please let me know. IRC and email have not proven useful. Thanks!
